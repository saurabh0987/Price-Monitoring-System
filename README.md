# Price-Monitoring-System
The goal of Price Monitoring system is to notify user when price of selected items on e-commerce website hits below specific price set by the user.

I have used BeautifulSoup(BS4) for scraping prices and product info and also used requests library for making HTTP requests.

I have also implemented email notification using SMTP and python3 using SMTP and email library.
